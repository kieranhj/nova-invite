Come join us at the UK's only demoparty, now taking place online between 19-21 June 2020. More details at [novaparty.org](http://novaparty.org)!

Released at the Outline Online demoparty on 23 May 2020, winning 2nd place in the combined demo compo!

Inspiration for this demo came from the KAOS part of the [Budbrain Megademo](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=4063), released at the Amiga Conference 1990. A big shout out to Diablo and Pyscho of Budbrain for such a legendary prod!

The music and sequencing for this demo was composed using [Arkos Tracker 2](https://www.julien-nevo.com/arkostracker/). Many thanks to Julien Nevo for developing & supporting this tool.
